Hi, guys I'm a noobie with no coding experience I just wanted to make a program/script that will make the bo3 launching experience a bit more smooth, so I used chatGPT to code this Python script. this is more a concept rather than the final product but it works just fine for now 
if you just want to launch the bo3.
what does it do?
first, you select the location of the patch then the path of the game, and
then the program stores the location so it knows where they are each time you open it, it will launch the patch and then the game.
sorry for grammar mistakes English is not my native language
